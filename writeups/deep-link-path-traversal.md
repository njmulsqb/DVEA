# Deep Link → Path Traversal — Writeup

Module: Deep Link Hijacking
Lab page: `src/renderer/pages/deep-link-path-traversal.html`
Vulnerable code: `src/main/main.js`

## 1. Objective

Craft a deep link that reads a file outside the app's intended directory.

---

## 2. Exploitation walkthrough

**Step 1 — find the route.** `handleDeepLink(url)` in `src/main/main.js` has a second
branch, gated on `parsed.host === 'open'`, that reads a `path` query parameter and hands it
straight to `fs.promises.readFile()` — no allowlist, no canonicalization, no check that the
path stays anywhere near the app's own files:

```js
// Route: open/read a file (dvea://open?path=...)
const openPath = parsed.searchParams.get('path');
if (parsed.host === 'open' && openPath && mainWindow) {
  try {
    await mainWindow.loadFile(path.join('src/renderer/pages', 'deep-link-path-traversal.html'));
    try {
      const content = await fs.promises.readFile(openPath, 'utf8');
      mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, content });
    } catch (err) {
      mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, error: 'Read failed: ' + err.message });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load route2 page for deep link open:', err);
  }
  return;
}
```

`new URL('dvea://open?path=/etc/passwd')` parses with `host === 'open'` and
`searchParams.get('path') === '/etc/passwd'` — confirmed directly against Node's URL
parser — so the real attack primitive is:

```
dvea://open?path=<attacker-controlled file path>
```

**Step 2 — build the payload.** Because `openPath` is passed to `readFile()` completely
unvalidated, both an absolute path and a relative traversal sequence work:

```
dvea://open?path=/etc/passwd
```

Clicking this on a packaged install drives the trusted window to this lab's page and
displays the contents of `/etc/passwd` — a file with no relationship whatsoever to DVEA's
own directory — proving arbitrary file read.

**Step 3 — reproduce locally without OS scheme registration.** As with the Untrusted
Navigation lab, running from source doesn't reliably register `dvea://` with the OS. The
"Simulate Deep Link" button exercises the identical unvalidated read via the
`simulate-deeplink-open` IPC handler:

```js
// src/main/main.js
ipcMain.handle('simulate-deeplink-open', async (event, requestedPath) => {
  try {
    const p = requestedPath;
    const content = await fs.promises.readFile(p, 'utf8');
    return { content };
  } catch (err) {
    return { error: 'Read failed: ' + err.message };
  }
});
```

Type `/etc/passwd` into the lab's path field and click **Simulate Deep Link** — the result
panel shows the raw file contents, fetched by the main process with the app's own
filesystem permissions.

**Step 4 — confirm against a bundled target.** DVEA ships a small marker file at
`src/renderer/pages/secret.txt` containing `FAKE_SECRET=flag{dvea_demo_secret}`. Typing
`src/renderer/pages/secret.txt` (relative to the app's working directory when launched with
`npm start`) reproduces the same read against a file that *does* live under the app's own
pages directory — useful for a reliable, permission-independent demo — while `/etc/passwd`
or any other absolute path proves the read is not actually confined to that directory at
all.

## 3. Vulnerable code vs. fixed code

**Vulnerable** (`src/main/main.js`, inside `handleDeepLink`):

```js
const openPath = parsed.searchParams.get('path');
if (parsed.host === 'open' && openPath && mainWindow) {
  try {
    await mainWindow.loadFile(path.join('src/renderer/pages', 'deep-link-path-traversal.html'));
    try {
      const content = await fs.promises.readFile(openPath, 'utf8');
      mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, content });
    } catch (err) {
      mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, error: 'Read failed: ' + err.message });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load route2 page for deep link open:', err);
  }
  return;
}
```

**Fixed** — canonicalize the requested path and confirm it stays inside an intended base
directory before reading it:

```diff
+const ALLOWED_BASE_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, '../renderer/pages');
+
 const openPath = parsed.searchParams.get('path');
 if (parsed.host === 'open' && openPath && mainWindow) {
   try {
     await mainWindow.loadFile(path.join('src/renderer/pages', 'deep-link-path-traversal.html'));
     try {
-      const content = await fs.promises.readFile(openPath, 'utf8');
+      const resolvedPath = path.resolve(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, openPath);
+      const relativeToBase = path.relative(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, resolvedPath);
+      const isConfined =
+        relativeToBase !== '' &&
+        !relativeToBase.startsWith('..') &&
+        !path.isAbsolute(relativeToBase);
+      if (!isConfined) {
+        throw new Error('Requested path escapes the allowed directory');
+      }
+      const content = await fs.promises.readFile(resolvedPath, 'utf8');
       mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, content });
     } catch (err) {
       mainWindow.webContents.send('deeplink-open', { path: openPath, error: 'Read failed: ' + err.message });
     }
   } catch (err) {
     console.error('Failed to load route2 page for deep link open:', err);
   }
   return;
 }
```

The same confinement check belongs in `simulate-deeplink-open`, which performs the
identical unchecked `readFile(requestedPath)`.

## 4. Why the fix works

- **`path.resolve(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, openPath)` collapses the path before any decision is
  made.** `path.resolve` processes segments right-to-left and folds out any `..`/`.`
  components, producing one final absolute path. This defeats relative traversal payloads
  like `../../../../etc/passwd` — verified directly: `path.resolve(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR,
  '../../../../etc/passwd')` collapses to an absolute path outside the base, which the next
  check catches.
- **It also defeats the absolute-path bypass, which is the more realistic attack here.**
  Node's `path.resolve(base, target)` has a specific, easy-to-miss behavior: *if `target` is
  already absolute, `base` is discarded entirely* — `path.resolve('/allowed/dir',
  '/etc/passwd')` simply returns `/etc/passwd`. A confinement check that only strips `../`
  sequences from the input (a common but incomplete fix) would miss this completely, because
  the attacker never needs `../` at all — supplying `/etc/passwd` directly is enough, and
  that's exactly the shape of the working payload in this lab. Catching this requires
  checking the *final resolved path*, not the input string.
- **`path.relative(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR, resolvedPath)` is what actually catches both cases.**
  If the resolved path is inside the base directory, the relative path between them never
  starts with `..` and is never itself absolute. If it climbed outside (via `../` segments
  or because it was absolute all along), the relative path is forced to start with one or
  more `..` segments to express "go back up and over" — verified directly for both
  `/etc/passwd` and `../../../../etc/passwd` against this exact check. That's the concrete
  signal the fix rejects on.
- **Compare resolved paths, not string prefixes.** A naive check like
  `openPath.startsWith(ALLOWED_BASE_DIR)` is also bypassable by a sibling directory sharing
  the same prefix (e.g. an allowed dir `/app/pages` vs. an attacker-supplied
  `/app/pages-evil/secret`, which passes a plain `startsWith` check while pointing somewhere
  else). Resolving first and comparing via `path.relative` avoids this class of bug entirely
  because it reasons about actual path structure, not raw string matching.
- **Fail closed.** Anything that isn't confined throws, and the existing error path already
  sends `{ path, error }` back to the renderer — no behavior change on the happy path, and
  no partial read ever happens for a rejected request.
